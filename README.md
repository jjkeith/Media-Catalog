# Hi5 Code Challenge
**By JJ Keith**

April 20, 2018

* Used [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to generate a quick base for a react app
* Added Bootstrap dependencies for expedient and tidy gridding and utilities
* Added Sass because why not enjoy nice things?
* Betrayed my preference in the battle with favicon

TODO
* With more time, this would be sliced up more. `Cards.js` is bearing way too much weight.
* Accommodate articles in alphabetizing
* More error checking
* Ability to sort ascending or descending
* Further dry out code
